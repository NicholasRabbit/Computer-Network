(1) The maximum emission rate is 500 packets/s and the minimum transmission rate is 350 packets/s.

(2) Hence, the traffic intensity is 500/350 = 1.4 which is larger than 1. 

(3) The values are different. The first is approximate 10.5 ms and the second is about 8.8 ms. 

(4) The reason is packets arrive randomly during these two experiments.
