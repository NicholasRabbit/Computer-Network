R12. What advantage does a circuit-switched network have over a packet-switched network? What advantages does TDM have over FDM in a circuit-switched network?

(1) The advantage that a circuit-switched network has over a packet-switched one is end systems can reserve a connection in the former one, therefore, there is no queue. It is a dedicated network. 

(2) In TDM, every connection has the all bandwidth of a circuit-switched network. Message can be transmitted at the full rate of this network in a specific and periodic time.

R21.  [Queuing and Loss Applet](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/ph/esm/ecs_kurose_compnetwork_8/cw/content/interactiveanimations/queuing-loss-applet/index.html)

(1) The maximum emission rate is 500 packets/s and the minimum transmission rate is 350 packets/s.

(2) Hence, the traffic intensity is 500/350 = 1.4 which is larger than 1. 

(3) The values are different. The first is approximate 10.5 ms and the second is about 8.8 ms. 

(4) The reason is packets arrive randomly during these two experiments.
